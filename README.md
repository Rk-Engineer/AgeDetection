## Introduction
The Age Detection System is a Java-based application that uses the OpenCV library to estimate a person's age from live video input. This project can be used in various applications like security, surveillance, and age-specific content recommendation systems.

## Features
- Real-time age estimation from live camera input.
- Integration with OpenCV for image processing.
- Lightweight and easy to set up.

## Technologies
- **Java**
- **OpenCV** for image processing
- **Maven** for dependency management

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Maven (if using Maven for dependency management)
- OpenCV installed

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/age-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd age-detection
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Run the project:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.Main"
   ```

> Note: Make sure OpenCV is properly installed and configured for your system.

## Usage
- Run the project and it will open your webcam.
- The system will try to detect faces in the camera feed and estimate the age in real-time.
